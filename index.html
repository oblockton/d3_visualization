          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Income, Poverty,Smoking, and Age</h2>
          <p>In the table above we can observe that most state have a median income under $60,000.
            Those data points with a high income, tend to loosely correlate with an increase in age. As expected, states with a high income will display an inverse graph
            when selecting for percent in poverty. However these relationships are not mutually exclusive. It would be possible to observe a high median income with a high
            percent in poverty, depending on how poverty is defined. If cost of living was included in categorization of a person living in poverty, then one might see high incomes and
            high incomes. However the cost of would have to be eggregiously high. Example of the variance in the relationship between poverty & income can be
            seen when examining the Arkansas(AK) and DIstrict of COlumbia(D.C) data points. Both data points share similar income levels, however the percent in poverty
            varies greatly between the two states.</p>

          <p>According to our vizualization there seems to be a clear relationship between income and smoking characteristics. Smoking displays a downtrend as income increases. This relationship
            persists when selecting for Poverty percentage.</p>
